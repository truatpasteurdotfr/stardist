GitHub often has problems displaying Jupyter notebooks. Hence, we recommend to [look at our example notebooks here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stardist/stardist/tree/main/examples/other2D) or use the links below.

### StarDist with additional object classification

- [Multi-class: Data, Training, and Prediction](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stardist/stardist/blob/main/examples/other2D/multiclass.ipynb)

### Prediction for very large images

- [Big data prediction](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stardist/stardist/blob/main/examples/other2D/predict_big_data.ipynb)

### Export StarDist model as BioImage.io model (BioImage Model Zoo)

- [BioImage.io model export](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stardist/stardist/tree/main/examples/other2D/bioimageio.ipynb)

### Export detected objects as ImageJ ROIs

- [ImageJ ROI export](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stardist/stardist/blob/main/examples/other2D/export_imagej_rois.ipynb)

### Older example notebooks that show more about the inner workings of StarDist
