GitHub often has problems displaying Jupyter notebooks. Hence, we recommend to [look at our example notebooks here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stardist/stardist/tree/main/examples/) or use the links below.

- [StarDist for 2D](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stardist/stardist/tree/main/examples/2D)
- [StarDist for 3D](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stardist/stardist/tree/main/examples/3D)
