We currently don't have additional example notebooks that work with 3D data.

However, many of our 2D example notebooks show methods that can also be applied to 3D data:

- [StarDist with additional object classification ("multi-class")](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/blob/main/examples/other2D/multiclass.ipynb)
- [Prediction for very large images](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/blob/main/examples/other2D/predict_big_data.ipynb)
- [Export as BioImage.io model (BioImage Model Zoo)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stardist/stardist/tree/main/examples/other2D/bioimageio.ipynb)
